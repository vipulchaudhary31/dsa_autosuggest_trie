# dsa_autosuggest_trie
To implement an auto-complete system in C++ using Trie Data structure.
We have a Trie, and when a user enters a character, we have to show the matching string the Trie. This feature we call it as auto-completion. For example, if a Trie contains "catalog”,"catexam", "catchan" and when the user enter “cat”, then we have to show them catalog, catexam etc.
